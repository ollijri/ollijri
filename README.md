I am a Computer and Cyber Forensics First Class Graduate from the University of Gloucestershire.

I have a background working as an infrastructure technician. I have a huge passion for Cyber Security.
    
I am the Project and Events Coordinator for the Ethical Hacking society at the University of Gloucestershire and have previously had the opportunity of being course representative in my brief time at the University of South Wales.
